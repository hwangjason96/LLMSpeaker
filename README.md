2a) purchase an audio unit, or an amplifier that could allow for a mic and speaker input/output.
2b) Authorize the google voice activation to read speach to text.
2c) Investigate how the voice activation could lead to running softwares and doing functions on the Pi.

3. Make design specifications and circuit layout.
3a) learn how to install a speaker using the audio card with the pi.
3b) learn how to embed a microphone that could pick up sounds despite the speaker.
3c) make some foundational layout on what the speaker might look like.

4. learn how to use a design software that could connect to a 3D printer.
4a) investigate softwares, and start coding/designing.
4c) find someone who can give you advice on the UI/UX element of the speaker.

5. Print the Speaker housing.
